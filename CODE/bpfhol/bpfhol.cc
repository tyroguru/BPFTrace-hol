/*
 * Placeholder for bpfhol main control code. This will be the central point of
 * control for all workload generators that are ran as part of the labs. I
 * forsee that, for example, to run the syscall lab generators as user would
 * do:
 *
 *  # bpfhol syscalls
 *
 * And this would fire off the workloads associated with the syscall labs.
 * To stop the generators when they have finished with a lab they would just
 * do:
 *
 *  # bpfhol stop
 *
 *  That kind of thing anyway.
